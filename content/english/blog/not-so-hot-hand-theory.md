Do you remember the scene from the Big Short where Selena Gomez and Richard Thaler were explaining CDOs? If not, close this blog post immediately and go watch the Big Short.

In that scene Richard Thaler mentions something that I haven't thought about in a while: the *Hot Hand Fallacy*. According to [The Decision Lab](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/hot-hand-fallacy):

> The hot hand fallacy is the tendency to believe that someone who has been successful in a task or activity is more likely to be successful again in further attempts. The hot hand fallacy derives from the saying that athletes have “hot hands” when they repeatedly score, causing people to believe that they are on a streak and will continue to have successful outcomes.

The concept of the "hot hand" is prevalent in basketball. This theory suggests that, on occasion, a player's shooting ability can inexplicably increase for a period. It's also referred to as being "on fire", "in the zone", or "in rhythm".

The intuitive appeal of the hot hand is understandable. We often experience states of heightened performance across various activities, not just sports. These states, commonly referred to as "flow", involve feelings of effortless execution, focused attention, and a sense of control. In such moments, success can appear inevitable due to the synergy between physical and mental states.

But as Richard Thaler mentions in that scene in the Big Short, the hot hand does not exist. While the "hot hand" is a popular concept, extensive data analysis suggests that shooting success might be largely driven by randomness. Our brains, however, are wired to detect patterns, potentially leading us to misinterpret random streaks as evidence of a hot hand.

I recently had a thought: *Considering the "hot hand" theory as a fallacy, where each shot attempt is independent, a successful performance today wouldn't be influenced by yesterday's performance. In this scenario, the probability of having a good shooting day remains constant across different days.*

So today's success is not based on yesterday's hot hand. The probability of having a great day today, is the same as it was yesterday and the same as it will be tomorrow. You have as much of a chance of having a great day today as during a hot hand. Hard to truly extend this to real life as on most days it feels like today is not independent of yesterday. If you got a cancer diagnosis today(God forbid), you are probably not going to have a great day tomorrow either. I call that the "cold hand" fallacy. If you just completed the sale of your tech startup for billions of dollars today, you are probably going to have a great day tomorrow. That feels like a hot hand to me!

But for the optimist that I am becoming, I wake up each day and treat it as an independent event. Because yesterday's sins and mistakes do not need to dictate today. It's a clean slate, an opportunity to do better, so treat it as such. I call that the **Not So Hot Hand Theory**.
